# Blacklist
Blacklisted public keys along with why and by whom they were reported.

To include an offending key in this list you may
- create a [PR](https://github.com/securelay/blacklist/pulls) to this repo after adding the file `PUBLICKEY.json`. See [sample](./B2Uw1gs2u8s.json) for template.
- create an [issue](https://github.com/securelay/blacklist/issues)
- email this organization at: [securelay.github.io@gmail.com](mailto:securelay.github.io@gmail.com)

### Example
Any request with private key `AAVaudCvNMd` is blocked because its corresponding public key is [blacklisted](B2Uw1gs2u8s.json).
